Ask Me Anonymously is a protoypte for an interactive ice breaking game on your smartphone developed for the course Mobile Information Systems at the Bauhaus University Weimar. It is inspired by the paper : "Design and Evaluation of a Multi-Player Mobile Game for Icebreaking Activity"by Pradthana Jarusriboonchai, Aris Malapaschas and Thomas Olsson from the Tampere University of Technology. 
The differences to te original idea are: 
- Use a multi platform serverless communication protocol: AllJoyn by the AllSeen Alliance.
- Got rid of the initial question anwsering round that keeps players quietly on their phones for a few minutes.
- Have a deeper Qustion DB that is targeted for adults and multiple usage. 
- Allow players to add their own questiond to the Database.
- Let players rate between DB questions and their custom question so that the question which most players are interested in gets asked.
- Less interactivity on the phone: Players anwser the questions in public. 
- Spin the bottle: Only one random selected player has to anwser the troublesome question. 
- Flickering animation between all phones that stops at one player.

All in all this game (if further develped) has potential to be not a one time app but a social game that players can keep on their phones. It allows for interaction moderated by the smartphone app. Therefore both strangers and friends might enjoy to use the app. 

Next milestones: 
- Improve the question DB with a broader set.
- Improve animation to really toggle between screens and not flicker randomly. 
- Deeper Use of AllJoyn communication protocol instead of "hacked in" player counter. 
- Nicer layout instead.
